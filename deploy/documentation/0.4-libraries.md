# 0.4 Libraries

Composing libraries is essentially like managing a set of CSS files—sensibly grouping classes and naming them according to established standards. This approach ensures clarity, maintainability, and consistency across your stylesheets.

Well-structured grouping and naming conventions help in scalable CSS architecture and make it easier to extend or modify the libraries over time.

## Naming Files
```
{cluster}.{order}.{name}.css
``` 

- **cluster** : `string[A-Z a-z 0-9 -]`
- **order** : `0|1|2`
- **name** : `string[A-Z a-z 0-9 -]`

## Managing Library Files

```
{cluster}{'$'*order}{Normalized(selector)}
```
#### Example

The classes defined in this file are accessed from other files using the following symbolic class references.

```css
/* anim.1.animation.css */

.none {
  transition: none;
} /* Symlink: anim$none */

.all {
  transition: all 300ms ease;
} /* Symlink: anim$all */

.transform {
  transition: transform 300ms ease;
} /* Symlink: anim$transform */

.opacity {
  transition: opacity 300ms ease;
} /* Symlink: anim$opacity */

.fade-in {
  @--attach anim$_keyframes_fade-in;
  animation-name: fade-in;
} /* Symlink: anim$fade-in */

@keyframes fade-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }

  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
} /* Symlink: anim$_keyframes_fade-in */
```

All the first order blocks of each file will have a corresponding symbolic class generated. This will be use full in cases where custom rule block has to be linked with classes.

## Special CSS Directives

```css
.classname {
  @--apply $class-1 $class-2 $class-1;
  @--attach $attach-1 $attach-2;
}
```

### `@--apply`
- Compose styles from predefined classes from libraries using symlinks.
- Values derived from this action is overridden by explicit properties

### `@--attach`
- Creates dependency with other classes using its symbolic-class representation.
- Library classes have dependent-style and composable-style of same value.  

## Inheritence Pattern:

- `order` is the hierarchy level for library inheritance. Lower order files provide base/axiom styles; higher order files can reference and extend lower orders. Use `order` to control applyment (`@--apply`) and attachment (`@--attach`) visibility and override behavior.

### Types of Libraries

- Provided editor intergration are aware of these libraries and give only appropriate suggestions according to active files.

#### Axiom

- `cluster` = `''`
- A special cluster without a cluster-name. ( Example: 0.display.css )

- In a file of **Order `n`**, symbolic classes may be referenced from other files using two distinct directives, with in the scope of `axiom` where permitted sources are:
	-  `@--apply`: Files of **Order ≤ n−1**
	-  `@--attach`: Files of **Order ≤ n**

#### Clusters

- Named clusters can access all symbolic classes from Axioms.
- In a file of **Order `n`**, symbolic classes may be referenced from other files using two distinct directives, with in the scope of whole `axiom` and `cluster` were permitted sources are:
	-  `@--apply`: Files of **Order ≤ n−1**
	-  `@--attach`: Files of **Order ≤ n**
