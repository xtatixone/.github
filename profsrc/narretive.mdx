> There's a **standerdized syntax** for CSS frameworks if you want it, and built-in **scoped classes**, **compile-time unique ID hashing**, and **inline cascade control**. It also offers a **CSS framework that grows and adapts with your project**, **multi-mode stylesheet generation**, and **isolated component composition with live previews**.

> I come from a mixed background — part electronics, part design — and somewhere along that path, I fell into web development.  
> Over time, I realized I didn't have the patience to deal with a dozen disconnected tools just to make one thing work. I wanted something simple: a tool that did what I needed, stayed out of my way, and gave me room to create freely.

> What began as a tiny npm package for CSS slowly grew past its limits — creeping into HTML and evolving into something more ambitious. But I knew where to stop.  
> My battlefield was clear enough: **HTML** and **CSS** — **structure**, **style**, and all the **chaos** that comes with it.
