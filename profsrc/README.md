XTATIX unifies HTML structure and CSS styling into a single declarative language. Write responsive layouts in one coherent syntax, compiled to optimized vanilla web code at build time.

#### ⚙️ Core Technology

- **Built in Go (Golang)** — Provides a fast, stable foundation for high-performance processing.
- **Compile-Time Preprocessor** — Converts the declarative XTATIX syntax directly to vanilla HTML/CSS at build time, ensuring zero runtime overhead.
