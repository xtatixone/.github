# Getting Started

Welcome to **Alchira**—the declarative UI language that treats structure and style as a single, unified intent.

In traditional web development, you are often forced to juggle HTML templates and CSS stylesheets, bridging the gap with fragile class names. Alchira eliminates this friction by fusing them into a **single source of truth**.

### How it Works

1. **Sketch your UI:** Wrap your elements in a `<sketch>` to define a regional boundary.
2. **Declare Intent:** Use symlinks (like `global$header`) to attach style rules directly to your structure.
3. **Use Smart Tokens:** Apply your pre-defined layout logic (like `@#Mmd` for media queries or `@#Cmd` for container queries) to make your components responsive by default.
4. **Compile:** The Alchira compiler distills your "rich declaration" into lean, production-ready HTML and CSS.

## Node Package

- Alchira is distributed via **npm**.
- Custom flavors created by independent developers are also published on npm.
- You can install an existing flavor for your project, or create a personal flavor and reuse it across projects.
- To start your own flavor, use the scaffold template: https://github.com/alchira/scaffold

### Core runtime (alchira)

- **Package:** [alchira](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alchira)
- Installs the appropriate core binary for your OS.
- Provides the CLI used to orchestrate flavors and run builds.

```bash
# Local Installation
npm install -g alchira
# Local Command Run
alchira {command}
al {command}

# Global Installation
npm install --save-dev alchira
# Global Command Run
npx alchira {command}
npx al {command}
```

### Flavored Template (@alchira/scaffold)

- **Link:** [@alchira/scaffold](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alchira/scaffold)
- [alchira](#unflavoured-alchira) will be installed along with flavor and all the commands will work the same manner.
- To initialize flavour run

```bash
# Local Initialization
npx al init {flavor-package-name}

# Global Initialization
al init {flavor-package-name}
```
