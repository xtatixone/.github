XTATIX unifies HTML structure and CSS styling into a single declarative language. Write responsive layouts in one coherent syntax, compiled to optimized vanilla web code at build time.

#### ⚙️ Core Technology

- **Built in Go (Golang)** — Provides a fast, stable foundation for high-performance processing.
- **Compile-Time Preprocessor** — Converts the declarative XTATIX syntax directly to vanilla HTML/CSS at build time, ensuring zero runtime overhead.

#### 🚀 What XTATIX Delivers

- **Unified Syntax for CSS + HTML** — Structure and style in one place, no context-switching.  
- **Standardized Syntax for CSS Frameworks** — Consistent syntax whether you use built-in or external frameworks.  
- **Component‑First Design** — Scoped composition without JavaScript framework overhead.  
- **Designer‑Friendly Workflow** — Visual-first authoring that compiles to clean production code.  
- **Personalized Flavors** — Native support for CSS framework variants and custom styling systems.  
- **Scoped Classes by Default** — Automatic isolation for predictable, conflict-free styling.  
- **Compile‑Time Unique ID Hashing** — Locally unique identifiers for precise scoping.  
- **Inline Cascade Control** — Fine-grained style override control directly in markup.  
- **Adaptive CSS Framework** — A stylesheet system that scales and evolves alongside your project as it grows.  
- **Multi‑Mode Stylesheet Generation** — Generate modular or unified stylesheets based on your build.  
- **Live Component Preview** — Isolated component composition with real-time updates.  
- **Creative Toolbox Philosophy** — Not a framework, but a system that flexes around your workflow.

> That's the tricky part. It lives in this weird intersection between tools we already use.  
> It comes with a **macro system for XML/HTML-like syntax**, but instead of shipping with a mountain of prebuilt classes like typical CSS frameworks, it lets you start from zero — or bring your own if you prefer.

> There's a **standerdized syntax** for CSS frameworks if you want it, and built-in **scoped classes**, **compile-time unique ID hashing**, and **inline cascade control**. It also offers a **CSS framework that grows and adapts with your project**, **multi-mode stylesheet generation**, and **isolated component composition with live previews**.

> It's not a framework in the traditional sense — more like a creative toolbox that bends around your workflow.

> I come from a mixed background — part electronics, part design — and somewhere along that path, I fell into web development.  
> Over time, I realized I didn't have the patience to deal with a dozen disconnected tools just to make one thing work. I wanted something simple: a tool that did what I needed, stayed out of my way, and gave me room to create freely.

> What began as a tiny npm package for CSS slowly grew past its limits — creeping into HTML and evolving into something more ambitious. But I knew where to stop.  
> My battlefield was clear enough: **HTML** and **CSS** — **structure**, **style**, and all the **chaos** that comes with it.
