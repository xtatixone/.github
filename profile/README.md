### Alchira: Start Simple, Scale When You Need


#### Level 1: Want to use Utility classes?

Use ~ to trigger class loading in place:

<div class="~flex ~flex-col">
  Click me
</div>

Provided that these classes are either available in libraries, or defined atlease once.


#### Level 2: Just want create new style?

Add $ for local scope:
```html
<div class="~$button_lu" >
  Click me
</div>
```

That's it. Styles with structure. No separate CSS file.
Reusable in same file.
```html
<button class="~$button_lu">
```

#### Level 3: Want reusable components?

Add $$ for global scope:
```html
<div class="~$$button" >
  Click me
</div>
```
Now its reusable accross project.


#### Level 4: What to group styles?

Add prefix as group identifier
```html
<div class="~group$$button" >
  Click me
</div>
```
Autosuggestions collects these in to separate groups and make navigation easier.


#### Level 5: Want to create varients?

Declare varients using attribute selectors like native CSS.
```html
<div class="~L5$$button" varient-1  >
  Click me
</div>
```
Variables are exposed in tooltips for along with the comments, if hovered over it.


#### Level 6: Extented styles later?

Extend using attribute selectors like native CSS.
```html
<div class="~L5$$button L6$extend-localy" varient-3 >
  Click me
</div>
```
The exposed variables will assit in providing the contract by existing classes.


#### Level 7: Want to wrap you class in other selectors and Queries?

```html
<div class="L7$style" 

>
  Click me
</div>
```
will be compiled to
```css
.L7$style {
    color: black
}

@media (min-width: 620px) {
    .L7$style {
        color: red;
    }
}
```

You can even chain multiple queries with:
    `{Query}&{.parent-class}&{[varient-state]}&="..."`


#### Level 8: Need cascade control?
- `~` for utilities (basic)
- `+` for components (stricter overides)
- `=` for overrides (final overides)

Multiple declarations will be used for establish the oranizaion of classes in while resolving inline classes. but it will help in the long run

#### Level 9: Need to design components in Isolation?

Use `<sketch> </sketch>` tag
```html

```
These components can be previewed in your editor webview, with live output

### Install and Setup

```bash
npm i -g alchira         # If you prefer npm

<summary>
  <b>Mission 0: 🎁 Essentials</b>
  <br />
  Composing and Nesting, Inline cascade control, Variants, 1st Order Wrappers,
  Dependent tracking.
</summary>
<hr />

These features alone provide a CSS framework that grows alongside your project from Zero. This "Successful Fusion" is achieved through the following core pillars:

- **Composing & Nesting:** Define UI as a unified structural topology.
- **Inline Cascade Control:** Master the cascade with `~`, `+`, and `=` operators.
- **Variants:** Manage state and regional logic directly within the declaration.
- **1st Order Wrappers:** Responsive logic (@#Mmd / @#Cmd) integrated as primary intent.
- **Dependent Tracking:** Automated structural awareness to prevent stylesheet bloat.

> <br /> Not a Css/Js framework. Actually not even a framework.

> <hr />
> So what is it then? It's a **major fix for a minor problem**.  
> A problem that always manages to get in the way and turn into a constant source of frustration. A worked on a few a landing pages in vanilla stack and it was not a very pleasent experience HTML/CSS context switching, cascade hell, scoping, style override, i hope i don't have to explain every one did went through those. 
> Then i tried a few frameworks astro, svelte and react(i might get a lot, of hate for this, but react never really got clicked for me). And in addtion to those framework, every time these problems were stacking up as they scale.

> <br/>A little bit of this, a little bit of that — hard to sum up in one word.
> </summary>
> <hr/>
> That's the tricky part. It lives in this weird intersection between tools we already use.  
> It comes with a **macro system for XML/HTML-like syntax**, but instead of shipping with a mountain of prebuilt classes like typical CSS frameworks, it lets you start from zero — or bring your own if you prefer.
>
> There's a **standardized syntax** for CSS frameworks if you want it, and built-in **scoped classes**, **compile-time unique ID hashing**, and **inline cascade control**. It also offers a **CSS framework that grows and adapts with your project**, **multi-mode stylesheet generation**, and **isolated component composition with live previews**.

> It's not a framework in the traditional sense — more like a creative toolbox that bends around your workflow.

> It comes with very few rules — and almost unlimited flexibility.  
> You can make things fast, break things faster, and fix them just as easily. That`s the fun part.

> <hr/>
> I come from a mixed background — part electronics, part design — and somewhere along that path, I fell into web development.  
> Over time, I realized I didn't have the patience to deal with a dozen disconnected tools just to make one thing work. I wanted something simple: a tool that did what I needed, stayed out of my way, and gave me room to create freely.
>
> What began as a tiny npm package for CSS slowly grew past its limits — creeping into HTML and evolving into something more ambitious. But I knew where to stop.  
> My battlefield was clear enough: **HTML** and **CSS** — **structure**, **style**, and all the **chaos** that comes with it.
