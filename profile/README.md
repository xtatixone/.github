"Do you see it, Edward? Look closely at the stream. For decades, they told us these two souls—HTML and CSS—must live in separate vessels. They called it 'separation of concerns.' I call it a tragedy of fragmentation.

But look now... there is no 'link' tag. There is no 'external stylesheet.' I have spliced the DNA of the structure directly into the spirit of the style. They are no longer two things pretending to be one; they are a Successful Fusion.

It's stable, Edward. It's declarative. It's... beautiful. We've created a Chimera that doesn't just bark—it renders."

npm i -g alchira         # If you prefer npm

### ⏳ Next Mission: 

> Unlocks once all previous issues have been resolved.


<details>

<summary>
  <b> Mission 1: 📦 Sketchpad </b>
  <br />
  Sketchpad Instant Previews. Faster Workflows.
</summary>
<hr />

**Stop guessing and start seeing:** Sketchpad brings live previews directly into your editor or external browser.  
While the built-in toolkit is lean and focused, it is designed to be fully extensible—allowing you to rebuild or customize the interface to suit your specific architectural needs.

**Tailored to your stack:** Sketchpad comes bundled with your preferred flavor. Unlock additional flavors to unleash the full potential of your development environment and specialized toolsets.  
With instant server-side updates for every edit, your feedback loop is now instantaneous. Build faster, debug visually, and stay in the flow.

### 🔒 Future Unlocks


<details>

<summary>
  <b>Mission 2: 📜 (Chained Wrappers & Hashrules) + (Denest)</b>
  <br />
  Precise directives + conditional selectors
</summary>
<hr />

**Denest:** Destructive Nesting is a dedicated operator designed to keep long-chained selectors organized. It's the ultimate CSS power-up for managing complex UI states without losing code clarity.

**Multilevel Rule Control:** Manage rule states with precision using multilevel wrapping. By centering logic around the symlink, you ensure your styles remain both powerful and predictable.

**Hashrules:** Reuse & Scale Stop repeating yourself. Configure reusable wrapper snippets in `hashrules.jsonc`.

  - **Standardize:** Define snippets in `./alchira/hashrules.jsonc`.
  - **Sync:** Update a single file to reflect changes across your entire project.

<details>

<summary>
  <b>Mission 3: 📚 Libraries</b>
  <br />
    Automated Style-Symlinks for Rapid Composition.
</summary>
<hr />

**Centralized CSS Factories:** Bulk-generate class blocks in ./alchira/libraries. Each block is assigned a unique symlink handle, making global styles easy to track, manage, and scale.

**Preprocessor Friendly:** Start with the Essential symlinks bundled with your flavor, or unleash your own preprocessor to generate custom library sets on the fly.

**Deep Architecture:** Support for 6 levels of inheritance allows for highly structured design tokens. Use `@--apply`/`+` to merge these library foundations into final HTML component sketches for advanced state management.

<details>

<summary>
  <b>Mission 4: 🧩 Advanced Scope Control </b>
  <br />
  Unique IDs, Scoped Classes, and Local Styling.
</summary>
<hr />

**Better Organization:** Utilize local file-scoped symlinks to prevent naming collisions. Only export the symlinks required for the task, keeping your internal logic private.

**Collision-Free IDs:** Leverage unique file hashes to generate one-of-a-kind class names and IDs automatically.

**Sketch Compositions:** Effortlessly combine local styles into robust compositions while maintaining strict scope boundaries.

> I come from a mixed background — part electronics, part design — and somewhere along that path, I fell into web development.  
> Over time, I realized I didn't have the patience to deal with a dozen disconnected tools just to make one thing work. I wanted something simple: a tool that did what I needed, stayed out of my way, and gave me room to create freely.

> What began as a tiny npm package for CSS slowly grew past its limits — creeping into HTML and evolving into something more ambitious. But I knew where to stop.  
> My battlefield was clear enough: **HTML** and **CSS** — **structure**, **style**, and all the **chaos** that comes with it.
