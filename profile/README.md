"Do you see it, Edward? Look closely at the stream. For decades, they told us these two souls—HTML and CSS—must live in separate vessels. They called it 'separation of concerns.' I call it a tragedy of fragmentation.

But look now... there is no 'link' tag. There is no 'external stylesheet.' I have spliced the DNA of the structure directly into the spirit of the style. They are no longer two things pretending to be one; they are a Successful Fusion.

It's stable, Edward. It's declarative. It's... beautiful. We've created a Chimera that doesn't just bark—it renders."

### Install and Setup

```bash
    npm i -g alchira
    pnpm add -g alchira
    yarn global add alchira
    bun add -g alchira
```

Alchira works independently of frameworks or languages. Using NPM regisry provides convenient distribution (most frontend devs have Node), but functions perfectly in any non-Node codebase.

#### 🚀 What ALCHIRA Delivers

![Preview](../assets/preview.png)

- **Unified Syntax for CSS + HTML** — Structure and style in one place, no context-switching.  
- **Standardized Syntax for CSS Frameworks** — Consistent syntax whether you use built-in or external frameworks.  
- **Component‑First Design** — Scoped composition without JavaScript framework overhead.  
- **Designer‑Friendly Workflow** — Visual-first authoring that compiles to clean production code.  
- **Personalized Flavors** — Native support for CSS framework variants and custom styling systems.  
- **Scoped Classes by Default** — Automatic isolation for predictable, conflict-free styling.  
- **Compile‑Time Unique ID Hashing** — Locally unique identifiers for precise scoping.  
- **Inline Cascade Control** — Fine-grained style override control directly in markup.  
- **Adaptive CSS Framework** — A stylesheet system that scales and evolves alongside your project as it grows.
- **Live Component Preview** — Isolated component composition with real-time updates.  
- **Creative Toolbox Philosophy** — Not a framework, but a system that flexes around your workflow.

> That's the tricky part. It lives in this weird intersection between tools we already use.  
> It comes with a **macro system for XML/HTML-like syntax**, but instead of shipping with a mountain of prebuilt classes like typical CSS frameworks, it lets you start from zero — or bring your own if you prefer.

> There's a **standerdized syntax** for CSS frameworks if you want it, and built-in **scoped classes**, **compile-time unique ID hashing**, and **inline cascade control**. It also offers a **CSS framework that grows and adapts with your project**, **multi-mode stylesheet generation**, and **isolated component composition with live previews**.

> It's not a framework in the traditional sense — more like a creative toolbox that bends around your workflow.

> It comes with very few rules — and almost unlimited flexibility.  
> You can make things fast, break things faster, and fix them just as easily. That`s the fun part.

> <br/>I was too dumb to learn too many things and hold them all together in my head.

> <hr/>
> I come from a mixed background — part electronics, part design — and somewhere along that path, I fell into web development.  
> Over time, I realized I didn't have the patience to deal with a dozen disconnected tools just to make one thing work. I wanted something simple: a tool that did what I needed, stayed out of my way, and gave me room to create freely.
>
> What began as a tiny npm package for CSS slowly grew past its limits — creeping into HTML and evolving into something more ambitious. But I knew where to stop.  
> My battlefield was clear enough: **HTML** and **CSS** — **structure**, **style**, and all the **chaos** that comes with it.
