"Do you see it, Alfred? Look closely at the stream. For decades, they told us these two souls—HTML and CSS—must live in separate vessels. They called it 'separation of concerns.' I call it a tragedy of fragmentation.

But look now... there is no 'link' tag. There is no 'external stylesheet.' I have spliced the DNA of the structure directly into the spirit of the style. They are no longer two things pretending to be one; they are a Successful Fusion.

It`s stable, Alfred. It`s declarative. It`s... beautiful. We`ve created a Chimera that doesn't just bark—it renders."
